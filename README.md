### **Business Case**

We are a group of Data Analysts working for Blue Buffalo Insurance, a property casualty insurance company 
based in downtown Hartford, Connecticut. Our business partner wants us to conduct a thorough analysis using 
historical policy and claim data. As the insurance market changes, the business partner is concerned about the 
company's retention rates. Customers are more willing to change the status quo than ever before. With current 
inflation and a volatile market, everyone is looking for ways to save a few dollars. Our team is in charge of 
analyzing and exploring historical data to determine which customers are "high value" to the company and 
how the company might be able to offer additional savings or incentives to keep these customers from 
switching insurance companies. For this analysis, we must incorporate the customers' driving telematics, which 
tracks the customers' driving habits. The goal here is to identify a subset of 'high value' customers and 
recommend retention strategies to Blue Buffalo Insurance executives.
