## High-Value-Customer-Retention-for-Auto-Insurance-Company

#### _Case Competition : Winner of 2022 Travelers Business Insights & Analytics LDP Case Competition_


### **Business Case**

We are a group of Data Analysts working for Blue Buffalo Insurance, a property casualty insurance company 
based in downtown Hartford, Connecticut. Our business partner wants us to conduct a thorough analysis using 
historical policy and claim data. As the insurance market changes, the business partner is concerned about the 
company's retention rates. Customers are more willing to change the status quo than ever before. With current 
inflation and a volatile market, everyone is looking for ways to save a few dollars. Our team is in charge of 
analyzing and exploring historical data to determine which customers are "high value" to the company and 
how the company might be able to offer additional savings or incentives to keep these customers from 
switching insurance companies. For this analysis, we must incorporate the customers' driving telematics, which 
tracks the customers' driving habits. The goal here is to identify a subset of 'high value' customers and 
recommend retention strategies to Blue Buffalo Insurance executives.


### **Project Description**

In this case competition, we intend to analyze the dynamics that differentiate high-value customers. These 
dynamics will be of interest for the blue buffalo insurance company as they contribute to 80% of revenue.
In the dataset, we have 22 attributes which include personal information of record (like gender, age) and 
also the payment information of the customers (like premium, claims, fraud claims, etc.)
Coming to pre-processing, the dataset is merged into a single file. Next, we proceeded with basic 
preprocessing procedures like checking for null values or outliers. Further we came up with OUR (“time 
Travelers”) definition of HIGH VALUE CUSTOMER. In addition to that, new variables were created by 
feature engineering methods to reduce the complexity of the dataset, for example making it effective.
In pre-processing, the two datasets are combined into a single file. Next, we proceeded with basic preprocessing procedures like checking for null values or outliers.
In our next step, we came up with our (“Time Travelers”) definition of a HIGH-VALUE customer. Further, 
new variables are created by feature engineering methods to reduce the complexity of the dataset, for 
example making effective use of acceleration values. We also discarded some values that retain redundant 
information.
Finally, we found traits that can be attributed to high-value customers. Through this analysis, we found 
customers who could be classified as “high value customers”. Based on the findings we came up with 
some recommendations for the buffalo insurance company.
